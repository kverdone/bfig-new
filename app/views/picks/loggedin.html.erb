			<h1>Why BFIG will change your life</h1>
			<hr>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Last year, our champ took home <strong>a cool $13,500</strong>. This year, first prize should be <strong>$20,000</strong>. For those keeping score, $20,000 on a $25 wager is the best return since Enron.</li>
				<li>If your friend hasn't already told you that BFIG is The Best Damn Survival Pool, Period, then allow me to inform you that <strong>BFIG is The Best Damn Survival Pool, Period</strong>. Commish takes great pride in running a fantastic pool, complete with weekly previews, recaps and commentary.</li>
				<li>This is our sixth season, and 90% of the pool returns each year. <%= link_to "Read the pool history", '/pool-history', "target" => "_blank" %> if you're unconvinced.</li>

			<h1>How to pay (just do it now)</h1>
			<hr>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><strong>Your season fee must be in by the Sept. 11 deadline - no exceptions.</strong> Commish can't deal with Eli Manning-esque latency.</li>
				<li>We're using LeagueSafe - the leading fantasy dues service - this year. Here's what you need to know:</li>
				<li><strong>Pay here: <%= link_to "leaguesafe.com/join/2843532", 'https://www.leaguesafe.com/join/2843532', "target" => "_blank" %></strong></li>
				<li>Season fee is $25 and LeagueSafe will take 75 cents as a fee. So you'll pay $25.75 total.</li>
				<li>Commish makes NO profit from BFIG. I do this out of my love for football, my love for sportswriting, and my love for you (puppy eyes). Running this league costs a little bit (website hosting, email service, etc.) and that's all I remove from the pot.</li>
				<li>If you take home money for placing, LeagueSafe takes a $2 fee for cutting/mailing you a check. It's flat, so always $2 no matter how much you win. Commish can no longer write personal checks to all of you, and frankly, I wouldn't have time to run this pool if I had to collect and distribute money.</li>
				<li>LeagueSafe is run by <%= link_to "Paul Charchian", 'https://twitter.com/PaulCharchian', "target" => "_blank" %>, who does national radio and has been running fantasy businesses since the mid-90s. I chose them for their strong reputation.</li>
				<li>The friend that referred you will tell you Commish runs a tight ship. All payouts will be distributed at the same time, once the full season has concluded (January).</li>

			<hr>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>We need to start doing the jumbo check thing. Have a jumbo check guy? Send him my way.</li>
				<li>Our winner will get $20,000.</li>
				<li>Second place will get $7,000. The rest of the prizes descend from there.</li>
				<li>Roughly 5% of the pool gets paid. This year, that'll mean ~100 places.</li> 
				<li>The lowest places get $30. You can buy a six-pack of PBR with your profits and tell anyone who'll listen about how close you were to getting daddy a new car.</li>
				<li>If you drop out in weeks 1-4, you get to play in the Second Chance Pool - at no extra cost - starting in Week 5. It's the Wild West of survival, and the winner of that pool will take home $1,000.</li>
				<li>Additionally, there's a Week 12 pickem. Everyone can play at no extra cost. The winner of the pickeem (pick every game straight up) will get $300.</li>
				<li>Payouts for every place will be included in the Week 1 PICKS email.</li>

				<li>This pool has grown entirely through you referring your friends. It's a huge part of what makes it so much fun. You know a bunch of people in the pool, and for everyone else, you know which arm of the tree they belong to.</li>
				<li>Yeah, a tree. We have an actual BFIG tree that shows how we all know each other. It's awesome, and having a huge branch is second in prestige only to winning the title belt. Do you really want an empty branch?</li>
				<li>Shoot off some emails and texts right now. Again, the link your friends need is: <%= link_to "http://www.bfigsurvivalpool.com/signup?ref=#{current_user.referral_code}", "http://www.bfigsurvivalpool.com/signup?ref=#{current_user.referral_code}" %>.</li>

				<li>BFIG is a sports community, and skill-based, fantasy sports game.

The prizes awarded in BFIG are not based on the outcome of any single game or any single player performance. BFIG provides no information to participants that would reduce the impact of knowledge and skill on the outcome. BFIG is not a gambling business. BFIG does not take any profit from entry fees.
